Etch-a-Sketch Project with HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project is a virtual Etch-a-Sketch created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Grid. The virtual Etch-a-Sketch provides a grid-based painting experience that allows users to create unique and fun designs.

How it Works

The Etch-a-Sketch project is built using HTML and CSS to create the user interface, and JavaScript to handle the painting logic. The painting functionality is based on the HTML5 canvas element and the CSS Grid, which allows for easy creation of a grid-based layout.

The user can use the mouse cursor and paint. The color can be changed using a color picker, and the user can also adjust the size. The user can clear the Etch-a-Sketch screen using the "apagar" button.

How to Use

To use the virtual Etch-a-Sketch, simply open the "sketch.html" file in your preferred web browser. Use the mouse and click to move the cursor and paint. Change the color and  using the provided color picker and size slider. To clear the screen, click the "Apagar" button.

Customization

The virtual Etch-a-Sketch can be customized by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The CSS file controls the appearance of the user interface, while the JavaScript file controls the painting logic. You can modify the color and style of the user interface, as well as add new features to the painting logic.

Conclusion

The virtual Etch-a-Sketch created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Grid is a fun and interactive way to create paintings in a grid-based layout. This project can be used as a basis for creating other grid-based painting projects or can be integrated into other web projects.
